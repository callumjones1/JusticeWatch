Project Description

After 2001, the US expanded its definition of terrorism, impacting environmental and animal rights activism by associating it more closely with domestic terrorism. Legislation like the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act (AETA) targeted activists, criminalising activities that interfere with the animal agriculture industry.  This approach, coupled with the legal introduction of terms like ‘eco-terrorism’, led to increased surveillance and infiltration of activist groups. The fearmongering about radicalism among environmental activists, sometimes termed a ‘green scare’,  was met with concerns about the impact of increased securitisation and surveillance on social justice and civil liberties. The cases of environmental and animal rights activists being labelled as threats and facing severe legal consequences underscored the need for communities to be aware of how political dissent may be criminalised, particularly in situations of economic and environmental crisis and precarity.

In the wake of Islamophobia after 2001  and intensified patterns of criminalisation and surveillance in response to different social situations, there has been a concerning global trend of the rise of neo-fascist movements, escalating in recent years. Some of these groups attempt to co-opt environmental concerns to further their violent, supremacist, and exclusionary political agendas. Characterised by their anti-democratic, xenophobic, and nationalistic ideologies, these movements exploit societal anxieties over climate change, economic inequality, and other forms of social and technological disruption to garner support and legitimise their causes. 

While some attention has been paid to the growing far right alongside the increased criminalisation of environmental activism in the US, similar developments are gaining momentum elsewhere. Australia and New Zealand, the former being a major fossil fuel state and both being sites associated with recent cases of political violence claimed to have an environmental precedent,  are also experiencing shifts toward criminalising environmental and animal rights activism, though in different ways and extents than in the US. For instance, Australia’s stringent new laws against environmental protesters and New Zealand’s legislation potentially undermining environmental protections signal a global trend of increasing scrutiny and legal challenges for activists.

In Australia in particular, recent laws have significantly increased penalties for environmental activism, impacting the climate protest movement. New South Wales introduced laws in April 2022, targeting protesters who block roads and ports, with penalties including up to two years in prison and fines of AU$22,000. Victoria and Tasmania followed with similar measures against environmental protesters, including jail terms and hefty fines for those protesting at logging sites or supporting community protests. South Australia also proposed a bill to drastically increase penalties for ‘public obstruction’, with fines potentially reaching $50,000 or three months in jail. These measures aim to suppress civil dissent and public protest at a time when it is most needed, while new laws have obscured the manifestations of actual political violence by proponents of eco- and other neo-fascist belief systems on the far right.

The current situation provides a backdrop for this grant proposal, which seeks funding to launch an innovative, open-source website, the Justice Watch Network, dedicated to tracking and analysing prosecutions linked to political violence and civil activism in Australia and New Zealand-Aotearoa, covering the period from 2001 to the present. The primary aim of this project is to create a comprehensive repository that sheds light on the application of counterterrorism and other relevant legislation to individuals and groups involved in civil activism and politically motivated violence. By doing so, the website will serve as an important tool for understanding the legal and societal responses to a range of activism, from radical environmentalist movements to the disturbing rise of neo-fascist groups.

The project will meticulously code and catalogue cases, offering detailed insights into the legal frameworks utilised in these prosecutions. This includes an analysis of how laws are applied, the outcomes of these applications, and the broader implications for civil liberties and political activism. The website will feature a user-friendly interface that allows users to navigate through data, explore trends, and access in-depth case studies. Additionally, the platform will provide access to a wealth of documentary materials, including court documents, legislative texts, and media reports, enriching the context and understanding of each tracked prosecution. The anticipated outcomes of this project include:

Outcome	Description
Enhanced transparency and understanding	of the legal measures applied to political and civil activism, contributing to informed public discourse.
A valuable resource for legal practitioners	offering insights into precedents and the application of law in similar cases.
A tool for activists and civil society organisations	to understand the legal landscape and potential risks associated with their activities.
A comprehensive database for journalists and academic researchers	facilitating in-depth analysis of trends in political violence and activism-related prosecutions.

Reflection of Antipode’s Values and Parameters

This grant proposal aligns with the Antipode Foundation’s mission to promote empowerment, social justice, and make critical knowledge accessible, emphasising citizen journalism and the support of marginalised communities. Aimed at being a comprehensive legal case repository, the Justice Watch Network platform will enhance transparency and offer insights into the relationship between activism, law, and society. By providing detailed case studies, legal texts, and court documents, it supports citizen journalism, enabling individuals and marginalised groups to understand and engage with the legal challenges of activism. Designed to be user-friendly, the website makes important information accessible to all, especially non-experts, facilitating informed discourse, challenging misconceptions, and empowering marginalised communities and activists to share their stories and advocate effectively. For legal professionals working with activists, this resource is also invaluable. It offers detailed case analyses, insights into legal precedents, and supports the development of defence strategies and fair justice advocacy. Additionally, the project seeks to build a community among legal experts, activists, and journalists, enhancing the website’s value and fostering a culture of collaboration. This initiative aligns well with the foundation’s dedication to collective action and the creation of networks that bolster social justice and empowerment.

The Justice Watch Network project draws significant inspiration from The Prosecution Project (tPP, https://theprosecutionproject.org), a pioneering initiative that meticulously tracks and analyses terrorism prosecutions in the United States. Similar to tPP, the proposed project aims to create a comprehensive, open-source website dedicated to tracking and analysing prosecutions linked to political violence, but it also examines civil activism, specifically within Australia and New Zealand-Aotearoa. Dr Michael Loadenthal, the Director of tPP, has agreed to sit on an international advisory board guiding the development of this website, alongside Professor Richard Jackson, Professor Reece Walters, and Associate Professor Cai Wilkinson. 
Budget

Deakin University has committed AUD 15,705.07 (1 Australian dollar = 0.51 pounds sterling) in in-kind salary payments to support the establishment of the Justice Watch Network. This application to the Antipode Foundation seeks additional funding of $19,103.50 to cover essential aspects for the website’s creation, launch, and maintenance, along with the dissemination of its open-access content. The funding will be allocated to rigorous data collection and coding of prosecution cases into a searchable database, reflecting the nuanced landscape of political violence and activism-related prosecutions. The project’s outreach and engagement initiatives are designed to connect with key stakeholders, such as legal and justice practitioners, activists, and researchers, to foster an informed community and enhance the website’s impact. The planned allocation of funds addresses several crucial areas:

Area of Allocation	Description
